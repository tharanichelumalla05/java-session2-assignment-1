JAVA ARCHITECTURE:
Java architecture consists of:
                              1)Source code
                              2)Java compiler
                              3)Byte code
                              4)JVM
                              5)Operating System
Source code     :Programming langauge is a set of instructions which is used to create program.
                 These instructions which is used to create programme known as source code.
                 In this programme the source code convert into .classfile that is byte code.
                 Source code is a text document.
Java compiler   :Java compiler is a compiler for the programming language.
                 The most common form of output from a java compiler is java class file.
Byte code       :Byte code is the compiled format for java programms.
                 Once a java program is converted to byte code,it transferred across a network and executed by JVM.
JVM             :Java virtual machine is used to read the lines and execute that is responsible to execute java programm line by line.
                 JVM is used to run programms in JRE.
Operating system:Basically operatinvg system is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources.
                 Java os is a operating system with a java virtual machine as a fundamental component.
Java architecture also consists of JIT(JUST-IN-TIME) compiler.
Just-in-time    :JIT compiler improves  performance of java programms.
